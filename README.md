Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play.

## UX
 
Users of this website are looking for features such as the enjoyment and relaxation gained from gaming and the interactivity and competitiveness of a game.

## Wireframes

The Wireframes can be viewed [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54308513/72658124-86f75f80-39a4-11ea-80bb-223aec36be30.png).

## Features

- If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple; flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

- The game board consists of thirty cards arranged randomly in a grid. The deck is made up of fifteen different pairs of cards, each with different characters on one side. 

- A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol
- The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol
- If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
- If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state

		
- The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.


### Features Left to Implement
- I would like to add a score board and a click sound each time the player turns a card.
